# The Movie Database (TMDB)
*(cleaned from original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata))*


## Dataset

This movie database contains information about approximately 10,000 movies including genres, ratings, revenue, budget, and more. 
It contains movies which are released over 56 years between 1960 and 2015, it also has two columns for budget and revenue in terms
 of 2010 dollars accounting for inflation over time which will be used in any comparisons in my analysis instead of unadjusted ones.<br>



## Investigation

In this investigation, I'll be looking to answer some interesting questions like,

* how genres order of popularity changed over time?

* is higher rating means higher revenues for the movie?

* how are the cost of making a movie and total spending changed over time?



## Conclusion

* **Movies popularity** in general is increasing over time, but as it increases the most **popular genres** are nearly the same every decade with
 Drama on the top; people tend to prefer Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Adventure, and Action.<br>

* A **movie revenue** has a weak linear relationship with **rating**. However, the average revenues are bigger in the higher ratings.<br>

* **Movies budgets** are not related to time, as there are movies with budgets in every range every year, but the **average spending** in general
 started to increase linearly over time in the 1970s.<br>
